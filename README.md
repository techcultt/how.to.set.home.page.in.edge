By default, Microsoft Edge opens with a custom **“New Tab”** page full of content. Luckily, it’s easy to open the browser with a custom home page instead. You can also set the page that appears when you click a “home” icon on the toolbar, which is disabled by default.

## Set a single Homepage in Edge browser

A home page is a web address that is opened automatically when you fire up your web browser. You can set your favorite website, blog or search engine as your home page or you can set a blank page too.

* Open your Edge (Chromium) browser
* Click on the 3-dotted ‘Settings & More’ menu.
* Next click on Settings.
* Under ‘Settings‘ panel, click ‘Start, home and new tabs‘ section.
* Here, under When Edge starts, you can set Edge browser to:
	* Open the new tab page
	* Open tabs from previous session
	* Open these pages.

## Set multiple Homepages on Microsoft Edge

If you would like to add more websites to your Homepage. follow the steps outlined above and again click the Add a new page button. In the box that opens, type the next URL. In this way you can also add multiple URLs as the homepage in Edge.

If there are multiple sites opened, all of which you would like to add to your Homepage, select ‘Use all open tabs’ to convert all your open web pages to home pages.

The action will clear your current list of pages and replace them with all your currently open Edge tabs i.e., it will override preset configurations.

Lastly, if you wish to set a blank page as your home page, enter about:blank.
